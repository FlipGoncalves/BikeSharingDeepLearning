# Bike Sharing Deep Learning Prediction

## Problem
In the modern days, there is a ever lasting search for new ways to commute between two different places.

As such, the bike sharing business is blooming and each passing day, more companies are investing in this type of systems.

With this, there is a need to predict the number of bikes that may end their trip in each station, as for to be more useful for the user to understand and identity which stations he should drop his bike, or rent one.

## Solution
With this, I created two different models:
- Based on Stations
- Based on Time Span

### Stations Based Model
This model was created by dividing 40 stations into three different clusters: 60% for training, 20% for testing and 20% for validation.

### Time Based Model
This model was created by dividing the time span of our dataset, one year, into three different clusters: 8 months for training, 2 months for testing and 2 months for validation.
