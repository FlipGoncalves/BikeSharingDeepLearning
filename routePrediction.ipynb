    "A bikesharing business consists in creating a system which lets a user rent and use a bicycle as its own for a small period of time.\n",
    "However, the companies who invest in these types of business, can't gain much with just the system and services, they also need to promote the services and understand the most viable places to place the anchors, which are used to recharge the bikes or just save them, and which routes should be best for a user to take as to pass by some promoted caffes / restaurants / etc."

The add_node method adds a new node to the graph by creating a new instance of the Node class and appending it to the nodes list. The add_edge method adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph by finding the nodes with the corresponding values using the find_node method and adding each node to the other node's edges list. The find_node method searches the nodes list for a node with a matching value and returns it if found, or returns None if not found."
